# Important Jankiness Note
I made this a couple months ago for a midterm and haven't touched it since.
There are some janky bugs such as some .git files not loading into the camera's view making it hard to edit them at all.
Also I forget if adding a node is functional.

You may need to look at the .git file manually to see where the nodes are located to find them.

# Usage
You can copy this repo and go to bin/debug/ for the .exe. Or go to the releases and download it there.

Left click - select node, pan camera, drag/move nodes

Right click - Cut connections, create connection (right click on node to another)

Shift - Zoom camera out

Backspace - delete node

There is also undo functionality to an extent.

# Contributing
Feel free to edit this code however you'd like, it is a C# windows forms. I used Visual Studio 2019 but other versions (like 2022) should work.

If you can't contribute and a bug is really bothering you, feel free to make an issue and I'll try to get to it.
